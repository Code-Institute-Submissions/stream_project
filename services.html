                                <p>A professional wardrobe analysis will allow you to better understand and organize your wardrobe. By the end of this process, you will know what styles and shapes work best for you. We will do this by eliminating what doesn’t work for you and maximizing your wardrobe's efficiency so that you will never have another one of those 'nothing to wear' moments.

                                    Why have a Wardrobe Analysis?

                                    Do you have a wardrobe full of clothes and still feel like you have nothing to wear?

                                    Do you feel you wear the same items of clothing all the time?

                                    Do you think your wardrobe is outdated and want to inject some of the latest trends into it?

                                    How it works:

                                    The wardrobe analysis will take place in your home. This will allow me to analyze your wardrobe, establish what is lacking and fill in the missing pieces. It is an opportunity to identify the clothes you no longer wear, the clothes that no longer fit and the items in your wardrobe that are outdated. You will gain a better understanding of how to work with what is already in your wardrobe by building outfits and looks that match your lifestyle. It will also give you a solid foundation to work with for all your future purchases.

                                    Wardrobe Analysis can take up to 2-3 hours depending on the wardrobe size.<br><br>
                                    Avoid those impulse buys we are all guilty of.

                                        As a personal stylist, I offer a wide range of styling services for my clients. These services include personal shopping, wardrobe analysis, online styling, individual consultation, style workshops and much more. My goal is to provide a friendly and personable service, and create an individual authentic signature style for each of my clients based on their personality, lifestyle and budget. My styling service can save you time, money and even wardrobe space by ensuring you only buy versatile investment pieces that last for many seasons.



                                        <strong>Experience</strong>
                                        I previously worked as a fashion buyer and am currently a fashion tutor at Galway Technical Institute. While working in Dubai, I travelled extensively and discovered my passion for travel and fashion. I hold a Master's Degree in Corporate Strategy from NUIG and have completed courses in Fashion Buying and Fashion Styling at The London College of Fashion.

                                        "My diverse career path has given me a unique perspective and skill set that is exemplified through my styling services. My style is very much elegant chic with a little bit of edge. I think everyone should have their own individual authentic style that is informed by their personality and not entirely influenced by current trends".

                                        I hope to bring some of my style, love of fashion and success into your life.</p></h3>
